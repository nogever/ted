My first night at Langata Women Maximum Security Prison was the toughest.

Langata Women's Prison (LWP) is the only all women's prison in Nairobi.  It is a big compound, but there are over 750 prisoners, 50 children accompanying their incarcerated mothers and there are over 400 staff that reside in the prison compound due to security. LWP is comprised of a Remand Centre for short sentences and those awaiting trial or sentencing, a Medium Security Section for slightly longer sentences, and then the Maximum Security for the convicted and what we would consider federal offenses and long-term sentences.  There is also an onsite Nursery School where the prison staff children attend, the children of the prisoners and also some outside children are permitted to attend.  Children are allowed to stay with their mothers until they are 4 years old.  If the mother is still in prison once the child turns 4 then the child is sent to a children's home until the mother is discharged. There are even children born there!  What a setting for a child.

We go into the prisons, train them, give them skills, tools and support to enable them to be able to change their mindsets, their behaviors and their attitudes.
